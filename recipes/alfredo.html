        <P>A popular dish to make when you are in an Italian mood is the famous Alfredo.
            The dish was created by Alfredo di Leilo in the 1900s. Typically white cream is added to the dish to give it the impeccable flavor it's known for. 
            The shrimp adds extra flavor, that goes with the creamy meal. If you follow the recipe I provided you can this yourself within 30 minutes.
